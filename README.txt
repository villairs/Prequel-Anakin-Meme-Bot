This program overlays text on to an image.

The AnakinMemeGenerator.java takes 2 or 3 arguments.
First two arguments are the verb and prefix which will be used to construct text in the form

    topText    = i VERB them. i VERB them all.
    bottomText = and not just the PREFIXmen, but the PREFIXwomen and PREFIXchildren too.

For example if the two arguements provided are {paid, work} then the text would look like

The optional third arguement specifies the output file.
The file generated by the program will be in png form.

The default output file is "default.png" for no arguments, "custom.png" if arguments are provided but no file name is provided


The AnakinMemeGenerator requires the "anakinlol.png" file to be in the same directory to work.
